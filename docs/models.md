### Models
[back to main README](../README.md)

We provide our models trained on the whole UD 2.7 with the default seed:

* [concat](http://itu.dk/people/robv/data/machamp/ALLfullUDconcat.1.tar.gz)
* [smoothed](http://itu.dk/people/robv/data/machamp/ALLfullUDconcat.smoothed.1.tar.gz)
* [dataset embeddings (smoothed)](http://itu.dk/people/robv/data/machamp/ALLfullUDdatasetEmbeds.smoothed.1.tar.gz)
* [separate decoders (smoothed)](http://itu.dk/people/robv/data/machamp/ALLfullUDsepDec.smoothed.1.tar.gz)

After these are downloaded and extracted, we refer to the main [README](../README.md) for information on how to use them for prediction. (note that for the latter two models, one has to define which dataset to use with `--dataset `).
